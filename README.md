# Project Overview

This project is designed to help me learn and apply various web development concepts. By completing this project, I will gain hands-on experience in working with APIs, handling asynchronous operations, and building a user-friendly web application.

# Why

This project is assigned by The Odin Project to establish an understanding between the concepts described below.

API Integration: I will learn how to interact with external APIs to fetch weather data for a specific location. This involves making HTTP requests and handling API responses.
Asynchronous JavaScript: As API requests are asynchronous operations, I will learn how to write asynchronous JavaScript code using techniques such as promises or async/await to handle the API calls and data retrieval.
